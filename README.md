- [**Disaster Response Project (Udacity)**](./DisasterResponse)

A ML model was developed to classify disaster response messages. This could potentially accelerate response to catastrophes by routing responses to appropriate organization automatically. The model is exposed in a Flask server, with Plotly visualizations and packed into a Docker container. The container is then deployed with AWS Fargate.

- [**Article Recommendations Project (Udacity)**](./recommendations)

A Recommender System was developed for recommending technical articles about ML, Deep Learning, data science, databases, analytics, etc. for users. A mix of Rank based, Collaborative Filtering based (both User-User and User-Item), Content based methods were used in the recommender system.

- [**Churn prediction with Spark Project (Udacity)**](./spark-churn)

Users can play their favorite songs, create playlist, add friends, like/dislike songe, amoung other actions. The final model was deployed into an Amazon EMR Cluster.
