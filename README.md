MOOC and personal projects

- [**Disaster Response Project (Udacity)**](./DisasterResponse)

A ML model was developed to classify disaster response messages. This could potentially accelerate response to catastrophes by routing responses to appropriate organization automatically. The model is exposed in a Flask server, with Plotly visualizations and packed into a Docker container. The container is then deployed with AWS Fargate.

- [**Article Recommendations Project (Udacity)**](./recommendations)

A Recommender System was developed for recommending technical articles about ML, Deep Learning, data science, databases, analytics, etc. for users. A mix of Rank based, Collaborative Filtering based (both User-User and User-Item), Content based methods were used in the recommender system.

- [**Churn prediction with Spark Project (Udacity)**](./spark-churn)

A ML model for predicting whether users will churn was developed. Dataset is from a fictitious music streaming service with lots of users. Users can play their favorite songs, create playlist, add friends, like/dislike songe, amoung other actions. The final model was deployed into an Amazon EMR Cluster.

- [**CRISP-DM on the MIMIC-III healthcare dataset**](./crisp-mimic)

The idea of the project is to apply the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) process in the context of Healthcare, more specifically for Intensive Care Units (ICUs). By being more data-driven we could rapidly improve the treatments and the healthcare system as a whole (not just with ML models with predictive power but also provide healthcare professionals more qualitative evidence for supporting clinical decisions).
