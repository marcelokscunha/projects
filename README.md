- [**Disaster Response Project (Udacity)**](./DisasterResponse)

A ML model was developed to classify disaster response messages. This could potentially accelerate response to catastrophes by routing responses to appropriate organization automatically. The model is exposed in a Flask server, with Plotly visualizations and packed into a Docker container. The container is then deployed with AWS Fargate.
