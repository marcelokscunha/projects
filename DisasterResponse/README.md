# Udacity's Disaster Response Project 
## Introduction
Following a catastrophe typically disaster response organizations receive millions of messages from multiple sources like social media, news, direct communication from impacted area, and so on. This is also the moment that they have the least capacity to handle such volume of messages and filter those are the most urgent.

According to [FigureEight](https://www.figure-eight.com), it's common that only one in every a thousand messages is relevant for those disaster response organizations. In addition, usually each disaster response organization is responsible for helping with a specific part of the problem (e.g. one is responsible for solving the problem of supplying water, other for distributing medical supplies, etc.). Hence, after filtering messages, each part is contacted and the work is coodinated manually.

The idea of the project is to develop a ML model to classify disaster response messages. This could potentially accelerate response to catastrophes by routing responses to appropriate organization automatically. 

The project is based on the datasets provided by Figure Eight [[1]](https://www.figure-eight.com/datasets/)[[2]](https://www.figure-eight.com/data-for-everyone/).

For more explanation about how the data was prepared, which models were used, and more please refer to the [notebooks](./notebooks).
